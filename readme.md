# Recreate the Wikipedia Homepage - Epicodus

For this project my team worked on recreating from scratch the Wikipedia homepage using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap stylesheets. The goal was to demonstrate the proper use of bootstrap elements to render a webpage that looked as close as possible to the Wikipedia homepage. The Wikipedia homepage can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page
